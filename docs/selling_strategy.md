# Product & Licensing Strategy (MXN)

Given that the target business is a **micro-business** (1 founder, 2 employees) with monthly earnings not exceeding **$15,000 MXN**, pricing drastically changes from an enterprise model to a **Micro-SaaS or Shared-Success model**. 

A heavy enterprise setup fee ($15,000+ MXN) is out of the question since it represents their entire monthly revenue. However, a pure one-time sale remains a terrible idea for you because you will be locked into providing free tech support and paying for their servers out of your own pocket indefinitely.

Here is the strategy tailored for a micro-business:

## 1. The Micro-SaaS Subscription (Recommended)
This model relies on pricing the system as an unavoidable utility bill (like internet or electricity) but keeping it so low that it is an absolute no-brainer for the founder to pay.

*   **Pricing:** **$300 - $500 MXN / month.**
*   **Why it works for them:** It represents only ~2-3% of their $15,000 MXN monthly revenue. It's affordable enough that it doesn't terrify them, but meaningful enough that they value the tool.
*   **Why it works for you:** Because you selected **Quarkus** and **Svelte**, your actual server costs on a platform like Railway will be under **$100 MXN / month** ($5 USD). This means the single client pays for their server *and* immediately nets you $200-$400 MXN in monthly profit for doing nothing once deployed. As you sell this exact same system to *other* small businesses, your backend costs stay flat (since they share the same backend), and every new $500 MXN subscriber becomes 100% pure profit.

## 2. Low Setup + Micro Maintenance
If the founder prefers to "own" something upfront and despises purely renting software, you can combine a small setup fee with a mandatory "server maintenance" fee.

*   **Pricing:**
    *   **Installation/Setup:** **$2,500 - $4,000 MXN (One-time)**
    *   **Monthly Cloud Maintenance:** **$150 - $250 MXN / month**
*   **Why it works:** The founder gets the psychological satisfaction of "buying" the system. The $3,000 MXN setup fee compensates you for the weekend it takes to deploy the app and train the two employees. The $200 MXN monthly fee ensures you are never paying AWS/Railway out of your own pocket for their database.

## 3. The "Revenue Share" Model (Partnership)
If the founder simply has zero capital but the business has high potential based on the seasons (as mentioned in requirements), you can offer the system for "free" in exchange for a percentage of sales processed through the POS.

*   **Pricing:** **1% - 2% of total processed sales** or **a flat rate per transaction.**
*   **Why it works:** If they make $15,000 MXN, you make $150 - $300 MXN that month. If your inventory app helps them optimize their seasonal strategy and they jump to $40,000 MXN next year, your revenue automatically jumps to $800 MXN/month without negotiating a new contract. It perfectly aligns your goals with theirs.

## Crucial Developer Boundary for Micro-Businesses
When selling to businesses under $15k MXN/mo, they often demand excessive custom features ("Can it also do payroll?", "Can it message my clients on WhatsApp?"). 
*   **Strategy:** You must sell the app "AS-IS". The $500 MXN/month subscription is for the exact inventory/POS software you built. Any custom features they request must be billed separately at your hourly developer rate.

## Summary
For a business making $15,000 MXN/month, aim for a **$300 - $500 MXN / month Micro-SaaS subscription**, or a **~$3,000 MXN setup with a $200 MXN monthly maintenance fee**. This covers your lean Quarkus server costs and provides a steady profit margin as you scale to multiple small clients.
